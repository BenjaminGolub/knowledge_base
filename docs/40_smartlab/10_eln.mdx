# Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs)

## Introduction

Information technology continuously develops at a fast pace. For example, the smartphones we all carry on a daily basis in our pockets are much faster than a supercomputer from the 80s which you could barely fit in an average bedroom. Unfortunately, this accelerated advancement of information technology has not yet fully reached our chemical laboratories. The paper laboratory notebook is just as popular and widespread as it was 100 years ago, with the very essence of how chemical research data is documented - literally with pen and paper - having only made little progress over the last century. 

Transferring the advancement of the information technology into the lab (smartlab) does not necessarily mean tablets & touch screens in every corner of your laboratory. The term Smartlab is more about the interconnectivity of the entire workflow and handling research data according to the [FAIR principles](/docs/fair). ELNs help to assign rich [metadata](/docs/metadata) to experiments and make the collected data traceable as well as reusable. With the possibility to transfer data from measurement devices directly into the ELN, the ELN is the central storage with all data in one place. From the ELN, data can be easily published into repositories and transferred to suitable long-term [archiving](/docs/data_storage).

One of the most important things, that distinguishes an ELN from a white blank paper is the possibility to document [metadata](/docs/metadata) in a structured and ideally in a human as well as machine-readable way. See the following overview for more information on the differences between blank sheets, ELNs and laboratory information management systems (LIMS).

## Advantages of an ELN

ELNs help to link experimental descriptions directly to the collected data so that all information can be found in one place. Furthermore, data loss is avoided by secure data storage and backups. Storing all the data in one central place helps also with knowledge management because the data is easily findable and accessible, even for new members in a research project. The biggest advantage of an ELN is that [metadata](/docs/metadata) is stored in a structured and [standardised](/docs/format_standards) way. This also helps with publishing research results and transferring research data to a repository.
