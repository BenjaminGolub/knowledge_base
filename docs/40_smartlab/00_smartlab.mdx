# Smart Laboratory (Smart Lab)


The term smart laboratory does not refer to a laboratory where tablets can be found in every corner. The smart lab represents a holistic approach to data management [link data guide] in chemistry with seamless data flows. What does this mean? It means that all steps within a researcher's workflow [link domains] across the research data lifecycle [link data lifecycle] are interconnected in a digital way. For example, a researcher plans and documents [link data documentation] his experiment in an electronic lab notebook (ELN) [link ELN]. Any experimental data from devices such as spectrometers are then directly ingested by the ELN via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) [Link to wikipedia article]. 

The ELN then ideally assigns all the necessary metadata [link to metadata] automatically and appropriately for a corresponding workflow and converts proprietary data formats [link to data format standards] to open data formats. The ELN structures the (meta)data and experimental descriptions in a meaningful and sustainable way which is both human- and machine-readable (e.g., via the use of machine-readable chemical structures [Link to machine-readable chemical structures]). When the researcher chooses to publish [link to data publication] or archive [link to data storage] their data, it is then ingested seamlessly by a data repository [link to repository] or archive without much further work as the ELN has already appropriately prepared the dataset to meet a repository’s or archive’s requirements [link choose repository]. 

In this section, key components of the smart lab will be introduced to you.
