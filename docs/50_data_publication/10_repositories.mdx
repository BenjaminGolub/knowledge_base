## Introduction

Research data repositories are locations where digital objects are stored and made available to the public. They can be regarded as the core of research data sharing as they provide platforms to store, curate, publish, archive, preserve, and access data. Pre-print servers can also be considered as repositories, although these are tailored toward scientific articles rather than research data.

Repositories can be classified mainly according to:

- the type of objects to be stored (e.g. scientific articles or research data) and
- the domain of the data contained (field-specific or generic repositories),
<!--- the storage period of the data (e.g. at least 10 years) or
the data access and -reuse policy -->

Repositories can be hosted at institutional server or are provided by broader organisations or consortia such as NFDI4Chem.

## How do repositories work?

A repository is constituted by a repository software and a database. Researchers transfer their data to the repository typically via a web-based user interface, or the repository operators **harvest** the data from other platforms via appropriate protocols and interfaces.

Some, but not all, repositories curate and review the data before **ingestion**, with regard to their content and quality, and, sometimes, also regarding their legal aspects (copyright, data protection, [licenses](/docs/licenses)).

In order to allow data re-use by other researchers, [metadata](/docs/metadata) are required beside the actual data. Metadata describe the content of the research data and provide information about its creation, the methods or software used as well as legal aspects. Metadata can be either added manually or can be provided through other applications. The process to manually add metadata via a metadata editor can be compared to the process of submitting a manuscript to a publisher via the publishers submission system. 

One main function of repositories is to provide a search function with which users and machines can find, view and download data. In order to ensure that data are permanently referenced and can be cited, repositories assign unique [persistent identifiers](/docs/pid) (PIDs). This also enhances the findability and accessibility of research data. 

Repositories can also be certified (e.g. CoreTrustSeal). Such certification ensures that the data is citable, preserved in the long run and may also cover aspects of data curation and data quality. 

## Finding the right repository

Because of the multitudes of data repositories existing, users could better orient themselves using a research data repository registry such as [Re3data](https://www.re3data.org/), [OpenDOAR](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/opendoar/about.html), [ROAR](http://roar.eprints.org/) and [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/). Repository registry services are an essential component of [FAIR Data Principles](/docs/fair) as they should help researchers to navigate through thousands of data repository services to find the most appropriate repository for their data. 

However, due to complex landscape of existing repositories, these registries tend to provide confusingly long lists that do not necessarily facilitate the selection of a suitable repository.

## Repositories for Chemistry

In the field of synthetic and analytical chemistry, the repository [Chemotion](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome) was developed aiming to fill the existing gap for the preservation and publication of experimental work. Chemotion supports scientists in depositing and sharing data in a structured and transparent way. It is free of charge and its software code is available on GitHub. It uses available standardised identifiers such as the reaction **InChI** (RInChI and RInChIKey). In addition, it is possible to transfer data from an Open Source [Electronic Laboratory Notebook](/docs/eln) (ELN) into the workspace area of the repository. The main advantages of the Chemotion repository are:

- comprehensive functionality for the collection, preparation and reuse of data using discipline specific methods and data processing tools
- existence of automated procedures to ease data curation
- provision of functions for a seamless publication and citation of deposited data
- support of [Digital Object Identifier](/docs/pid) (DOI) generation, the comparison of the submissions with PubChem instances, and workflows for peer reviewing of the submissions including embargo settings
