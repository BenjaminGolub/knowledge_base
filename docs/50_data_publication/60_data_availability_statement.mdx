# Data Availability Statement

## Introduction

The data availability statement is part of the back matter of a manuscript. The back matter usually also contains information on conflicts of interest, author information, acknowledgements and the references. 

The data availability statement enables [linking of the manuscript](/docs/data/data_publication) to the corresponding FAIR dataset in research data [repositories](/docs/topics/repositories) via  [DOIs](/docs/topics/pid), alternatively using the repository-specific identifiers or accession numbers.

:::danger Notice:                                
Please note that data availability statements such as *'data available on request from the authors'* and *'authors have elected not to share data'* are unFAIR, as the data is neither findable nor accessible. Furthermore, statements such as *'data available in supplementary material of the article'* are unFAIR, if data is kept in supplementary PDFs, as this data is not interoperable and, hence, difficult to be reused.
