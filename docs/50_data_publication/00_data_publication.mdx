# Data Publication

:::info Applies to:
This article applies to all researchers who want to publish their data.

## Motivation

In chemical research, we strive to share results with others, commonly through articles in renowned scientific journals. To be able to actually work with and build upon these results, the scientific community also requires the data that the results were based on. 

Publishing and therefore sharing these chemistry research data in a [FAIR](/docs/fair) manner by also considering aspects such as [persistent identifiers](/docs/pid/), rich [metadata](/docs/metadata), [data formats standards](/docs/format_standards) for analytical data, and by providing [machine-readable chemical structures](/docs/machine-readable_chemical_structures), information on [license](/docs/license) and [provenance information](/docs/procenance/) adds value to the research results and enables discovery and reuse. 

Data publication is essential in ensuring findings are transparent and reproducible.

## Benefits of data publication

There are direct benefits for researchers who publish their data. Data publication increase your career recognition, enables new collaborations and provided a citation advantage compared to articles without an associated and linked dataset in a research data repository.

 Additionally, there are benefits for the research community such as that new research is made possible and research is more efficient. Also the public sector will profits by enhanced public trust in science as data publication allows for validation of research results. Nonetheless, there is an economic benefit of data publication if results can re reused by the private sector.

## How to start

There are to main ways to publish research data:

- publish data in a [research data repository](/docs/repositories/)
- publish a separate [data article](/docs/data_articles/) with the corresponding dataset published in a [research data repository](/docs/repositories/)

Field-specific repositories should be the first choice as these repositories enhance the FAIRness of data on behalf of the submitters. To retain the same level of FAIRness, data publication in generic repositories require manual FAIRification.

[Smart Lab](/docs/smartlab) solutions, such as [Chemotion ELN](/docs/chemotion_eln/), can offer built-in workflows to assist researchers in publishing data. If the data is already documented in a structured way in Chemtotion ELN, then the data can also be published in this structured way via Chemotion Repository.

A [Data Availability Statement](/docs/data_availability_statement) in the back matter of a manuscript communicates how the data has been shared and how it can be accessed by others. Datasets should be linked using [persistent identifiers](/docs/pid/). <!-- include more information on linking datasets to published article once we have best practice examples (De Gruyter pilot)-->

:::danger Notice:  
Still confused on how data publication in chemistry may look like? We do provide a consulting and data stewardship service via our [Lead by Example](/docs/lbe_intro/) project. Have a look at [Lead by Example](/docs/datasets) for one of NFDI4Chem's featured datasets!
