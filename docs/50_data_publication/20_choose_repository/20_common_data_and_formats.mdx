# Selection Criteria

The consortium for chemistry (NFDI4Chem) within the NFDI aims to support researchers in collecting, storing, processing, analysing, publishing, and reusing research data by establishing a federation of repositories. To identify the **core repositories** that are part of the federation and have potential for development, the TA3 repository team has selected the following criteria:

-   The repository is suitable for the deposition of molecule-related data
-   The repository contains reusable data or functionality such as viewers, editors, or analysis tools that fulfil the needs of the NFDI4Chem community
-   The repository software is open source
-   The operators of the repositories have declared their willingness to adapt their services to the standards developed by NFDI4Chem as well as the [FAIR data principles](/docs/fair/)
-   The repository operators can be funded in accordance with the funding guidelines of the NFDI, i.e. the main operator is based in Germany and is a non-profit organisation

The repositories that fulfil the above-mentioned criteria are reported in the following list as **core repositories**. Cases that do not meet all criteria are included as associated or relevant repositories, supplementing the following list of recommended and trusted, chemistry-friendly repositories.

:::danger Notice:
Field-specific repositories should be the first choice as these repositories enhance the FAIRness of data on behalf of the submitters. To retain the same level of FAIRness, data publishing in generic repositories requires manual FAIRification.
