# Identifiers

Identifiers are typically unique codes aimed to identify something in the material or digital space. For example, a research group may have a fixed naming method for identifying samples within their projects. In data management, identifiers can include [persistent identifiers (PIDs)](/docs/pid) such as digital object identifiers [DOIs](https://www.doi.org/) to persistently refer to published articles and research datasets or software in [repositories](/docs/repositories). [Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs)](/docs/eln) and [archiving](/docs/data_storage) systems will typically also use an identifier system. Specific to chemistry, [InChI] codes serve as an identifier for chemical substances.
