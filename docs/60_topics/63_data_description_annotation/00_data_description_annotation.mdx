# Data Description & Annotation

To best understand a dataset at hand, whether it be for yourself, your working group, or others in the scientific community, it must be clearly described. To this end, data annotation and data description are both important aspects of data management and analysis. 

Data description involves providing a detailed overview of the data, including its characteristics, format, structure, and any relevant context. Research data annotation is the process of adding labels or notes to data to make it more easily understandable and accessible for analysis. In using rich machine-readable [metadata](docs/metadata), data annotation and description allows both humans and machines to make informed decisions about the suitability of the data for their research and ensure that the data is properly attributed and cited.

Furthermore, metadata used for either data description or annotation can be semantically described, employing controlled vocabularies, or better yet, [ontologies](/docs/ontology) to reduce ambiguity, making them machine-readable and machine-*understandable*. This facilitates searching and also finding datasets for machines and humans alike.
