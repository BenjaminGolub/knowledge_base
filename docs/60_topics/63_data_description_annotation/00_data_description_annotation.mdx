# Data Description & Annotation

To best understand a dataset at hand, whether it be for yourself, your working group, or others in the scientific community, it must be described. Annotating data involves adding tags, or rather [metadata](/docs/metadata), that describe the dataset. Furthermore, these metadata can be semantically described, employing controlled vocabularies, or better yet, [ontologies](/docs/ontology) to reduce ambiguity, making them machine-readable and machine-*understandable*. This facilitates searching and also finding datasets for machines and humans alike.
