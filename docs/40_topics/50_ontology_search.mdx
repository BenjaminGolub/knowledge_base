:::info Summary:
The term ontology, as used in our context, refers to a formally specified conceptualisation of a certain research domain that is focused on answering the question of what can and needs to be represented in this domain. An ontology thus defines a collection of technical terms that can be used to semantically describe research data in a [FAIR](https://nfdi4chem.chemie.uni-mainz.de/knowledge_base/docs/topics/fair/) and machine-readable way by the means of annotating the research data with these technical terms. This is best done automatically behind the scenes by your everyday work apps like the [ELN](https://nfdi4chem.chemie.uni-mainz.de/knowledge_base/docs/topics/eln/). However, as automated ontology-based annotation is not the standard yet, as ontologies evolve with the new insights gained from research, and, as they might contain term definitions which a domain expert (e.g. a chemist like you) might disagrees with, one needs to know how to browse and improve ontologies manually. The present article is meant to provide the necessary background needed for this.

# Introduction
Research data is more than the aggregation of numbers or images in a scientific journal article, experimental section, or supplementary information. To fully reproduce the deduction of the results, we need access to the raw data and how it was generated, processed and analysed. While humans can grasp all the semantics and knowledge expressed in articles and their experimental sections, computers can not do so without fine grained metadata annotations. Ontologies, taxonomies, terminologies or vocabularies can be used to semantically describe research data, producing this FAIR and machine-readable data.
Quite a few ontologies already exist for the semantic description of general scientific concepts and relations, as well as for chemistry specific ones.

# General Scientific Ontologies

## BFO
The Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/bfo) is the most widely used upper ontology for many existing chemistry domain ontologies that are part of [The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org/) project.
## SIO
The [Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO)](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/sio)
It has been used in [Bio2RDF](http://bio2rdf.org/), [SADI Semantic Web Services](http://sadiframework.org), [DisGeNET](http://rdf.imim.es/DisGeNET.html), [PubChemRDF](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rdf/), [EBI's Gene Expression Atlas](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/documentation/atlas) and the [Graph4Code project](https://wala.github.io/graph4code/). To foster semantic interoperability, SIO is mapped to BFO and RO for important core classes and relations.

# Glossary
In order to be able to speak about the existing ontologies in the domain of chemistry, we need to provide a very brief glossary of the most important technical terms that describe an ontology:
* **classes** represent those portions of reality that exist as generic entities, such as atoms and molecules, chemical reactions, lab equipment and experimental methods (e.g. the class *MassSpectrometer*)
* **instances**, **individuals** or **particulars** of a class are particular entities that exist in reality, (e.g. a particular mass spectrometer identified via a serial number)
* **relations** or **properties** are terms used to signify the interdependence between classes or individuals (e.g. a specific molecule *participates in* a certain chemical reaction)
* **taxonomy** refers to a hierarchical structuring of classes into superclasses and subclasses (e.g *MassSpectrometer is_a Device* or *HomoSapiens is_a Mamal*)
* **axioms** are the rules defined to express relations that always hold true between classes or instances of classes (e.g. *MolecularProcess* is a *process* that must have one or more *MolecularEntities* as its participants)
* **upper ontologies** conceptualize the most general parts of reality (e.g. time, space, material matter, process, causality, parthood, etc) and thus can provide a semantic framework for domain or application ontologies
** In a best case scenario there is only one upper ontology to be used by many domain ontologies to ensure their interoperability
* **domain ontologies** conceptualize specific aspects of a given domain (e.g. ChEBI conceptualizes only chemical entities like atoms and molecules as well as their roles in certain contexts)
* **application ontologies** are domain ontologies that are implemented in a concrete application and thus limited to the applications use cases
