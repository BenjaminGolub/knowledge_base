# Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs)

ELNs are a key prerequisite to a comprehensive, digital documentation of research data and are therefore of high importance for the capturing of data for further analysis or a later re-use. ELNs are available as either commercial, free or even open-source solution.[xx] They can be either discipline-agnostic or discipline-specific ELNs, some of them combine both aspects.[xx] The organization of work with ELNs that support chemistry-specific functions can offer several benefits such as the availability of chemical structure identifiers and standardized formats as well as the integration of manifold tools and workflows that facilitate scientific work. The direct integration of tools enables a direct support of the scientist without the need to search for additional services and software, thus bringing new developments and information directly to the scientistsâ€™ awareness. To date, only a few electronic lab notebooks meet the basic requirements of chemical sciences, probably due to the challenges arising with the drawing and processing of chemical structures, a crucial and central step for the correlation of research data with the corresponding chemical reaction or structure.[xx,xx] Examples for systems in chemistry that offer the necessary support of chemical structures and are available as an Open Source -as a requirement furth further adaptation by the community -  are Indigo-ELN, LabTrove [xx], OpenEnventory [xx] and Chemotion [xx].

## Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) in NFDI4Chem

NFDI4Chem will support those ELNs that are relevant for documentation of chemical research acitivities.
